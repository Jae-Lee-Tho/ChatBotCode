# Food Delivery Chatbot with Dialogflow and FastAPI

This project is an end-to-end implementation of a food delivery chatbot using **Dialogflow**, **Python (FastAPI)**, and a **MySQL** database.

## Overview

In this project, I build a smart chatbot that can interact with users to help them place food orders, check order status, and get delivery information. The system uses Dialogflow to handle natural language understanding, with a Python backend (using FastAPI) that connects to a MySQL database for managing orders and menu data.

## What I've Learned

- **Dialogflow Basics**: Intents, entities, contexts, and how to manage conversations.
- **Backend Development**: Setting up a FastAPI server to handle webhook requests.
- **Database Integration**: Interacting with MySQL to fetch and store order information.
- **Full Integration**: Connecting Dialogflow to the backend and database for a complete solution.

## Technologies Used

- Dialogflow ES (for NLP and conversation flow)
- FastAPI (Python framework for backend)
- MySQL (database for storing menu and order details)
- Ngrok or a similar tool (for webhook tunneling during development)
